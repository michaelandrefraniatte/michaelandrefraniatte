**• Refrain:** Author has seen too much times and too much stupids taking to him everything. Author never accepted it. Anyone can see everywhere works stolen, and how bad works can report a lot, even stolen. Author made only good and original works.  
  
**• Publishing:** Author doesn't allow anyone to take his works without the requirements and consents. Author doesn't allow anyone to take his works for make stuffs like if anyone is owning it. Author doesn't allow anyone to take his works to make what he wants.  
  
**• Availability:** Author did not set his works available publicly for anyone can come to take it freely. Any work deserve a salary. Unfortunatly, author could not count on the honesty of anyone. At the same time, works of author don't deserve to be lost.

**• Acknowledgement:** Author doesn't accept anyone come and rummage through his works as if it was garbage. Author deserves better, like to be acknowledged by many people because his works are of great values. In fact, he's only ignored and stolen.  
  
**• Visibility:** Author tried to have visibility on social networks and on forums, but in fact he was only banned and black listed. There are only thiefs and unrespectous persons insulting author. Author claims the deletion everywhere his works are stolen.  
  
**• Which:** How anyone taking freely works of author, can be so bad, so lazzy, so loathsome, a demon. Yet, it's not someone author would work with obviously. A disgusting hoodlum who only knows making like others and flooding bad works. Author says no.  
  
**• Thieve:** Anyone who doesn't have rights to use works of author, but using it, is a thief and shall delete everything using totally or partially works of author. Thieves are criminal acts which are punished by laws. Not being aware isn't tolerate.  
  
**• Forsaken:** Fortunately to anyone who owns, obtains, or uses freely works of owner, it's also free to delete everything. Author is advicing any thief to delete his works and forsake for life using it without waiting one second. This advice is also free.  
  
**• Price:** Being a sponsor isn't expensive to be allowed to use works of author, even if author accept only true sponsoring, for fees greater than cents, to avoid stupids like author already met in the past. Otherwise, thiefs owe to author far much more.  
  
**• Woke:** Author only met stupids who took him from above. They are considered as strong. They never let author to express a point of view. They impose what are impossible or not. They fired and stolen author and his life. Hope for thiefs disgust themselves.  
  
**• Disappointment:** Good for nothing but considered important, making moral, making job, winning a lot for nothing, having wings with rip off, coming to steal without believing to owe something. It's just lures. Tomorow nothing stay, nothing good.  
  
**• Burry:** To criticize author, the works of author, to not make the author known, and to not recognize his works, such idiots must live in a country full of idiots, on top of everything they did bad to him from the beginning.  
  
**• Groove:** Anyone doesn't dare to be a complete idiot, but it's too late for going back. Anyone had to think about it first. The damage is done, it's very funny, and author doesn't care anymore about the rest that will fall on him, he has just to watch now.  
  
**• Ignorance:** Author wasn't allowed to teach and continue his works, he's considered as a noob by real noobs. It would be smart to consult author against radioactive wastes to burry in a broken rock with fluid intrusions and without any impervious layer.  
  
**• Infringement:** Not being aware of the risk incurred against copyright laws isn't tolerate. Not respecting the copyrights and intellectual property of author is criminal. Who infringes this license agreement, owes to author the subsequent penalities.  
  
**• Having Rights:** Author, author's family after his death, sponsors.
