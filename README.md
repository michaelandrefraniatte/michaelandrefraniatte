  
Hi there,  
  
My works are nor open sources, I retain all rights to my source codes and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from my works. I didn't set any license in my repositories. If you are interested in my works, for using it at month, become a monthly sponsor, with a significative amount of tier, per work. It's normal, I own the entire intellectual properties, and I decide of my copyrights. If you obtained my works, you have to delete it, or to pay me at month for using it at month, by becoming a monthly sponsor. I tolerate only this way for you can using my works, and only in private manner. Nobody has any rights to steal my works again and again, I need my dues a few. In other terms, my works are copyrighted, even published publicly.  
  
If you have any project around my works, it's normal to advertise me and pay me in consequence of all the works I already did, and all the works I can do around my works to go further. I don't accept anyone to take my works. I can teach to anyone my works, but not to steal me, like with several cases already. You will not winning anything by doing it.  
  
If you are not agree with my author terms, you have to pay the maximum to me and to my publisher (here) for the copyright infringements, but also far more, for the rest and the worst behind, like the piracy of my brain and my mind, the moral and lethal damages, weaponizations, the recurring and organizational characterizations, and of relentlessness toward me.
