  
Hello, I'm Michael, a Doctor in Geosciences and a Web Developer. I created some source codes, algorithms, equations, hypothesis, methods, programs, libraries, websites, web applications, web services, pages, scripts, macros, configurations, datas, fluids, molecules, materials, examples, supports, informations, tips, concepts, ideas, designs, etc.  
  
If you use anything from me, thank you for considering my 25 years and more of works without being paid, with your small financial contribution, by becoming a sponsor.  
https://github.com/sponsors/michaelandrefraniatte  
  
My works are with documentations, showcases, and web applications:  
http://michaelandrefraniatte.github.io  
  
My works are in repositories with SDK and programs:  
https://github.com/michaelandrefraniatte?tab=repositories  
  
I can deliver my supports for using my works and I can teach my works to sponsors. I can make changes of my works and I can create new works around on demands. I accept re-use of my works to sponsors, for pushing it on my (new) repositories, by helping me: developing, testing, scripting, or traducing.

I'm the exclusive author of my works and I hold all copyrights and intellectual properties on it. For using anything, only in private manner, you need to be a sponsor, otherwise I'm not agree, like using in public manner or in commercial manner. No permission is granted for free use, and no one has any right to put his name on my works, even if my works are published publicly. No one is under obligation to use or under the threat of having to use. This means you have to delete my works if you aren't a sponsor. I retain all rights to my source codes and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from my works. Considering that I'm alone doing all my works, having spent all my times, and that I had to try alone to have visibilities on my works, without succeeding, it's totally unfair to steal from me anything again and again. You are warned. If you don't undestand me, learn the life. In 2009, I modelized and synthetized the Origin of Life, and since the first June 2010 I work on gamepads, I received only ignorance, scream, and insult, I'm only fired and stolen for everything I own, and since my 10 years old. I'm not joking, I have proofs about my copyrights and intellectual properties now, you really get serious problems playing with that and me. For this reason, I was forced to publish my works publicly, another reason it's of big interests in sciences nobody seems to see.
