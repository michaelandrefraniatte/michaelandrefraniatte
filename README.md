  
Hi, I'm a indie developer.  
  
I allow rights to use my works to sponsors only.  
  
I would like to have some money for my works.  
  
I can make changes of my works on demand.  
  
I can also make brand new works on demand.  
  
I have some works to finish and others to do.  
  
Thank you for your interest and patience.
