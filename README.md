  
Hi, my name is Michael, I'm a indie developer.
  
I allow rights to clone, and use my works to sponsors only. I want to have some moneys for my works. I can deliver supports for using my works, I can make changes of my works, and I can also make brand new works, on demands. I have some works to finish, and some others to do. I still allow sponsors to fork my works, in order to help me. I would like peer programing with anyone who would want. I can teach to anyone my knowledges.
  
I published my works because it would never be done, and it would be lost, but it don't deserve. I created lot of knowledges which would be stolen to me. I did some works of big scientific interests nobody can see, and I did some works which would take more than 100 years by 100 experts. I never give up, even dragged in the mud, like from start, even if I received only insults, and I've been fired for nothing, but I still care.
  
Thank you for your interest, thank you for become a sponsor.
