  
Hi, my name is Michael, I'm a indie developer.  
  
I allow rights to use my works to sponsors only.  
  
I would like to have some moneys for my works.  
  
I can deliver my supports for using my works.  
  
I can make changes of my works on demand.  
  
I can also make brand new works on demand.  
  
I have some works to finish and others to do.  
  
You can still fork my works for helping me.  
  
Some works I did would never exist without I publish it.  
  
Some works I did are of big scientific interests nobody can see.  
  
Some works I did would take 100 years by 100 advised experts.  
  
I never give up even dragged through the mud like from start.  
  
Thank you for your interest and patience, thank you for become a sponsor.
