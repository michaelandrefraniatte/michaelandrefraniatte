  
Hello, I'm Michael, a Doctor in Geosciences and a Web Developer.  
  
If you use anything from me, thank you for considering my 25 years and more of works without being paid, with your small financial contribution, by becoming a sponsor.

My works in documentations, showcases, and web applications:

My works in repositories with SDK and programs:  
https://github.com/michaelandrefraniatte?tab=repositories  
  
I can deliver my supports for using my works and I can teach my works to anyone. I can make changes of my works and I can create new works around on demands. I accept fork of my works to anyone for helping me: developing, testing, scripting, or traducing.

I'm the only one to own the copyrights and intellectual properties on my works, to use anything, only in private manner, you need to be a sponsor, otherwise I'm not agree, like using my works in public manner or in commercial manner.
