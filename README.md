  
If you use anything from me, thank you for considering my 25 years and more of works without being paid, with your small financial contribution, by becoming a sponsor.

I can deliver my supports for using my works and I can teach my works to sponsors. I can make changes of my works and I can create new works around on demands of sponsors. I accept re-use of my works to sponsors, for pushing it on my (new) repositories, by helping me: developing, testing, scripting, or traducing.
