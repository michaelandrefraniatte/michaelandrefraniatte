  
Hi there,  
  
My works are nor open sources, I retain all rights to my source codes and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your works. If you are interested in my works, for using it at month, become a monthly sponsor, with a significative amount of tier, per work.  
  
It's normal, I own the entire intellectual properties, and I decide of my copyrights. If you obtained my works, you have to delete it or pay me at month for using it at month. Nobody has any rights to steal my works again and again, I need my dues a few. In other terms, my works are copyrighted, even published publicly.  
  
If you are not agree with my author terms, you have to pay the maximum to me and to my publisher (here) for the copyright infringements, but also far more, the rest and the worst behind, like the moral and lethal damages, weaponizations, the recurring and organizational characterizations, and of relentlessness.

Regards,
